• Yo Mohamed, I improvised 'Linkable.add_link', logically a 'link' is a sequence between two nodes,
with that being said, if an element has linked with another element, then a sequence should be created at the same time
so, I modified the method to return a sequence.

• I added a really powerful method in 'BPMNElement', I called it 'configure', basically it's a life-saver, i should have introduced it earlier
but i didn't imagine that our code will get sticky.. basically it's an alternative for a constructor and an alternative for ALL the setters
imagine this situation: (it's easy to understand, it's just a 'reflection' thing.. u know that I love reflection.. so i expect that u saw this coming xD)

    obj = Object(id=1, name='yeah cool', angerLevel=0)
    
    # later on we need to update the attrs of that object, normally we will do..
    obj.id = 5
    obj.name = 'Not cool'
    obj.angerLevel = 100
    
    # with this method we will be able to do this
    obj.configure(id=10, name='Really Cool', angerLevel=0)

• Yo Mohamed, I made new changes, please review them... First of all i added the 'Definitions' class,
you can find a test unit named 'TestUnit_Definitions' for demonstration

• I implemented Message flows too, check Definitions class for more info

• I also tested DataStoreReference, and it worked, unfortunately I didn't test the other artifacts, but I guess they will work too ~(*_*)~

• Those were the MAJOR changes..
